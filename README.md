### Simple JavaScript App: Pokedex

# Thank you for using the Application!

- This is the small JavaScript App built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with their dependencies of: jQuery, Bootstrap and PokeAPI.
- This project displays 150 Pokèmons in the list of clickables buttons with their names, heights and pictures fetched from external PokeAPI.


### Context

The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that programming language. To learn my way around Api, Javascript and      Bootstrap, I worked on this simple pokedex-app with basic look-up functions. There is no CSS used in the finished version of the app, to push myself to use the limited and tedious ways bootstrap offers in regards to styling. Though I am ok with the final layout I, from now on, vow to never use bootstrap again, unless I am urged to do so with force. This was the first achievement of the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Course.
